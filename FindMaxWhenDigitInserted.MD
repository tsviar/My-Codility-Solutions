my java script solution 
( based on my half-baked test solution, where I saw the trick, but did not test fully on all negative numbers ))-: ...)

Write a function solution that, given an integer N, 
returns the maximum possible value obtained by inserting one '5'
digit inside the decimal representation of integer N.
Examples: 
1. Given N 268, the function should return 5268. 
2. Given N 670, the function should return 6750. 
3. Given N 0, the function should return 50. 
4. Given N -999, the function should return -5999. 
Assume that: N is an integer within the range [-8,000.8,000]
